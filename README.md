# Generate a word at random and store it in a variable.
# Display the length of the word to the user.
# Correct_guesses is less than the length of the word.
# Prompt the user to guess a letter.
# If the guess is correct increment correct_guesses by 1.
# If the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1 .
# If the incorrect_guesses is greater than 10, tell the user they lost and exit the program.
# If correct_guesses is equal to the length of the word, tell the user they won.
